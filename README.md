# NeurIPS2023-Spectral-Clustering-on-Incomplete-Data

The source code for the NeurIPS'2023 paper titled "**Boosting Spectral Clustering on Incomplete Data via Kernel Correction and Affinity Learning**".

## Introduction

This Github repository contains the implementation of our proposed *Kernel Correction* (KC) algorithm and a series of *self-expressive affinity learning* algorithms (i.e., *KSL-Pp*, *KSL-Sp*, and *AKLSR*), designed to refine kernel estimation and boost spectral clustering, particularly with incomplete data.

- **Kernel Estimation**: Anchored by the kernel matrix's positive semi-definiteness, the KC algorithm provides robust theoretical guarantee for kernel estimation, yielding improved results in kernel-based spectral clustering.

- **Self-expressive Affinity Learning**: The KSL-Pp and KSL-Sp algorithms employ proximal $p$-norm and Schatten $p$-norm penalties within the affinity learning framework to promote sparser affinity matrices. The AKLSR algorithm, an adaptive extension, iteratively learns high-quality kernel and affinity matrices through a joint optimization approach.
